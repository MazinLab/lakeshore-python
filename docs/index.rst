Welcome to the Lake Shore Python driver docs
============================================
The `Lake Shore`_ python driver allows users to quickly and easily communicate with Lake Shore instruments. It automatically establishes a connection and provides a variety of functions specific to the product such as configuring settings and acquiring measurements.
This driver is created and maintained by Lake Shore. Please visit the `github page`_ to report issues or request features.

Begin by completing the :ref:`installation` process then read up on :ref:`getting_started` with the driver.

Supported Products
==================
Some products are fully supported by the driver and do not require knowledge of the remote interface commands and queries. Instruments with basic support will establish a connection but require familiarity with the product's commands and queries.

Visit the :ref:`supported_instruments` section to view a complete list of products supported by the driver.
